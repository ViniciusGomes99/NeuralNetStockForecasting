# Neural Network for Financial Analysis

## Description

This project focuses on analyzing financial data and predicting financial outcomes using neural networks. The primary dataset includes various financial indicators, and the analysis aims to explore the relationships between these indicators and predict specific financial metrics.

## Key Features

- Data preprocessing and exploratory analysis using Pandas, Seaborn, and Matplotlib.
- Implementation of neural network models using TensorFlow and Keras.
- Evaluation of model performance with metrics like MAE, MSE, and R-squared.

## Technologies Used

- Python
- Pandas
- TensorFlow/Keras
- NumPy
- Seaborn
- Matplotlib
- Scikit-Learn
- Statsmodels

## Setup and Installation

Ensure you have Python installed on your system. Then, install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas tensorflow numpy seaborn matplotlib scikit-learn statsmodels
```
# Usage

To use this project, follow these steps:

1. Load your dataset (make sure it's in the same format as the provided dataset).
2. Run the data preprocessing steps to prepare your data.
3. Execute the neural network models and observe the results.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

The project includes extensive data analysis and visualization steps:

- Heatmaps for null value analysis.
- Scatter plots for analyzing relationships between variables.
- Correlation matrix visualization.
- Pair plots for insights into distributions and relationships.

## Neural Network Models

Three neural network models are implemented to evaluate different sets of features:

- Model 1: Uses macroeconomic features.
- Model 2: Focuses on financial indicators.
- Model 3: A combination of different feature sets.

## Results and Discussion

After training the models, the results are visualized and evaluated using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared (R2).

Discuss the outcomes, model performance, and any insights gained from this analysis.
